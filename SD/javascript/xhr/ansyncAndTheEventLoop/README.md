## Asynchronicity and the Event Loop

### Objectives
* Learn how JavaScript handles asynchronous functions.

* Investigate events and how they form a queue called the Event Loop on a single thread.

### Topics
*  [Asynchronicity](asynchronicity.md) 
*  [Heap, Call Stack, Task Queue, and Event Loop](eventLoop.md) 
*  [JavaScript Function Life Cycle](jsFunctionLifeCycle.md) 

### Resources
