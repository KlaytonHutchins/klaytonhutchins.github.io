### Content Assessment

Your goal here is to get comfortable with creating a well-structured HTML document and adding elements to it, without needing to Google the basic syntax and tag names.  After self-study and practice, you will have time to complete an assignment that we will assess in class to prove your knowledge of the subject. This assignment will require you to extend your HTML knowledge beyond what is covered in the tutorials.  **DO NOT** put off the self-study until the last minute.

### HTML Self-study and Practice
Complete three units of the Codecademy _[Learn HTML][Codecademy]_ course:
* _HTML Elements and Structure: Introduction to HTML_
* _HTML Elements and Structure: HTML Document Standards_
* _HTML Tables: Tables_  

Complete the _Forms_ section of either the [Quackit][quackit] or [HtmlDog][Htmldog] tutorials (or both).
* Note: Resources are also linked below.

Explore the HTML sections in the additional resources linked below. You do not need to complete all of these sections but you are expected to have a solid understanding of HTML upon completion.

A few of the resources also have some CSS content included. Feel free to look this over, however we will be providing you with some separate resources specifically targeting CSS basics.

You should have at least a fundamental understanding of the following HTML elements:

* Basic HTML document structure
* *Structural tags*: h1-h6, p, hr, blockquote, ul, ol, li, properly-nested lists.
* *Links*: a, href.
* *Images*: img, src, alt.
* *Tables*: table, tr, th, td, colspan, rowspan.
* *Forms*: form, input types, radio, checkbox, select/options, submit.
