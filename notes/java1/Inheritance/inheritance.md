## Inheritance

_Inheritance_ allows you to create a new class that contains fields and methods of an existing class, and add additional fields and methods.
* The class you inherit from is often called the _superclass_, and the inheriting class is the _subclass_.


### Practice Exercise
> _Superclass_ and _subclass_ are commonly referred to as _parent class_ and _child class_, respectively. You'll see both throughout this chapter.

### When to Use Inheritance
Use inheritance when you want to avoid representing the same thing twice, in two separate classes.
* A subclass is everything a superclass is, plus some.
* Many subclasses can all inherit from a single superclass.

### Practice Exercise
> Inheritance is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming. It allows developers to quickly expand the functionality of their programs, building on what was done before.
