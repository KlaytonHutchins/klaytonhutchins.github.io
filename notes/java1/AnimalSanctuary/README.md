title: Animal Sanctuary
---


In this project we will be modeling an animal sanctuary, where animals live happy lives, and are cared for by an attendant - until things go wrong.


The project is divided into three parts:


*  [Creating the Sanctuary](sanctuary.md) 

*  [Stretch Goal : Menu](menu.md) 

*  [Stretch Goal : Mayhem](mayhem.md)
