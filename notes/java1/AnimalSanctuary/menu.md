## Stretch Goal : Menu
Add a menu to allow users to:
* Start Attendant rounds
* Add an Animal
  * You will need to collect name and species (class type).
  * Choice of class type is best implemented as a numbered list, e.g.
    ```
    1. Elephant
    2. Hippo
    ...
    ```
* List all Animals by name
* Exit


(Note: The `Sanctuary` in the UML diagram has a field `currentAnimalIndex` for how many Animals are in the `Sanctuary`. This is so that we do not try to `add` more Animals than we have habitats for.)
