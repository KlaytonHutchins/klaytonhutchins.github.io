## Namespaces

In a Java method, each variable name can be declared only once.

* You can have variables `a` and `b`, but not two variables both called `a`.

* In a different method however, you can also have variables `a` and `b`.

Each method body is a _namespace_ for its local variables.

> #### namespace
> A set of unique symbols allowing us to refer to things by name without ambiguity.

In a folder, we can have only one file of a given name.

* You can have `Hello.java` and `Hello2.java` but not two files both named `Hello.java`.

In the filesystem, a directory is a namespace for filenames.
