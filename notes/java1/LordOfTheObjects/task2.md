## Task 2: Implementation

Start by implementing the core classes - items and characters, for example.

Wherever possible, use fields and method arguments of superclass or interface types.

Think about writing JUnit tests for key methods of these classes.

Having implemented the classes that model the in-game elements, you can start building the game logic.

Start simple and go a step at a time.
