## Testing Java Applications

So far, testing java applications has been a manual process.
1. Run the program.
2. Enter input.
3. Check output.
4. Determine which methods are broken.
5. Update methods.
6. Return to step 1.

* This can take most of your development time, especially if you are new to programming.

* Changes to a single method could break other parts of the system and must be retested.

* Imagine this process for a large application with many classes.

### Practice Exercise
One of the worst things you can do is push code that you have not tested. It does not matter how experienced or technical you are, you must test your code.
