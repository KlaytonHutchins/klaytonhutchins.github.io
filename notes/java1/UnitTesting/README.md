## Introduction to JUnit

Testing Java programs manually is costly and time consuming. We will introduce JUnit to allow us to write Java classes to test our Java code.

### Objectives

* Understand the purpose of automated testing.
* Be able to create JUnit test cases.
* Be able to create test methods that describe what a class's method should do.
* Understand and use JUnit `assert` methods to test class functionality.
* Understand the purpose of Test Driven Development (TDD).

### Topics

*  [Testing Java Applications](testing.md) 
*  [Building and Deploying Software](build-deploy.md) 
*  [JUnit](junit.md) 
*  [Test Classes](test-class.md) 
*  [Writing `@Test` Methods](test-methods.md) 
*  [`assert` Methods](assert.md) 
*  [`@Before` and `@After`](before-after.md) 
*  [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](tdd.md) 
*  [Labs](labs.md)
