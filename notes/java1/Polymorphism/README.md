title: Polymorphism and Overriding

## Polymorphism and Overriding
In this chapter we will learn about another pillar of object-oriented programming, _polymorphism_, which allows us to give subclasses specialized behavior, but still inherit behavior from superclasses.

### Objectives
* Use superclass references for subclass objects.
* Understand, recognize, and be able to use method overriding.

### Topics
*  [Polymorphism in Java](polymorphism.md) 
*  [Overriding Superclass Behavior](override.md) 
*  [`@Override`](override-annotation.md) 
*  [Rules for Overriding](override-rules.md) 
*  [Lab - Using Polymorphism](override-labs.md)
