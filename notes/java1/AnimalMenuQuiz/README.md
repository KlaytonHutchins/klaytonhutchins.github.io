title: Animal Menu Quiz
---


This quiz requires you to add code to the `AnimalsApp` class. There are 6 requirements listed in the class. You will

* Display a menu
* Instantiate an array
* Assign objects to the array
* Prompt a user for input, and accept that input
* Call methods, based on the user input (1 - 5)
* Create a method that takes an array input and loops through it

This is a graded quiz.

When you finish updating the class, send your code to your instructors using the private Slack channel used for project feedback. To send code in Slack, type three backticks (above the TAB key), paste your code, and follow with three more backticks. If Slack prompts you to send your code as a Code Snippet, do so.

**DO NOT SEND YOUR SOLUTION TO YOUR COHORT'S SLACK CHANNEL.**
