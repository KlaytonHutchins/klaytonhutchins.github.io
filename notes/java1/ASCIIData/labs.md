## Labs
For this lab we will accept user input and use information about the ASCII characters.

1. Write a program to prompt the user for a String and check if the String meets certain conditions.
   * Use `Scanner.nextLine()` to read in a `String` that may contain spaces.
   * Check if all characters in an input String are letters (upper or lower) and print a messaging saying the result.
   * Some `String` methods you might use:
     * `stringInstance.length()` - get the length of the `String`.
     * `stringInstance.charAt(i)` - get the `char` at index `i`, which starts at `0` (like an array index).

   (Solution: _AlphaNumCheck.java_)

2. Modify the program in (1) to see if the characters are alphanumeric (letters and numbers) or the space character.
