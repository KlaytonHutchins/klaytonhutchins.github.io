## Polymorphism and Casting
In this chapter we will continue learning about _polymorphism_, using the _IS-A_ relationship to cast object references.

### Objectives
* Be able to cast object references from one type to another.
* Understand the evils of field _hiding_, and why you will never use it in code.

### Topics
*  [Casting](casting.md) 
*  [Downcasting](downcasting.md) 
*  [Casting and Precedence](casting-precedence.md) 
*  [Hiding Instance Fields](instance-hiding.md) 
*  [Labs](labs.md)
