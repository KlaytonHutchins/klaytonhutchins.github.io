## Input - Process - Output
Regardless of the type of application, a computer program almost always
performs three basic functions:
1. Input some data.
   * From a file.
   * From the keyboard.
2. Process the data.
   * Formatting.
   * Calculating.
   * Searching.
   * Sorting.
3. Output the processed data.
   * To a file.
   * To the screen.
   * To a printer.

_Input_ involves gathering data from somewhere (a user, a file, a database, etc.) and bringing it into your application program so that it can be used.

_Process_ involves manipulating the data in a variety of different ways.

_Output_ involves taking the results of the process and sending it somewhere (to a user, to a file, to a database, etc.).
