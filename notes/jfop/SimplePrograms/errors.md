title: Compiler Errors and Runtime Errors
---

_Compiler errors_ are generated during the compilation of your program.
* These are mistakes that you've made in using the syntax and grammar of
the language; the compiler can't understand your instructions.
  ```java
  Str ing s = ;
  ```
  * What are `Str` and `ing`? And `s`?
  * What does `s` equal?
* You can't compile your program if there's a compiler error; if your program isn't compiled, you can't run it.

_Runtime errors_ are generated when you execute (run) your program.
* These are mistakes that you've made in the design and logic of your program.
* The compiler and the computer understand your instructions, but you've told it to do something unintended.
