If an exercise below requires using your solution from a previous chapter, copy-paste code from your existing program into a new class. If you did not finish the program from the previous chapter, use the solution found in _reference_.

1. Using your temperature conversion program from the section `IfElse`, create a new class named `IfCelsFahrLoop`. It will prompt the user to convert temperatures 5 times. (Hint: be careful of where you close your `Scanner`. This should be one of the last things the program does.)

   (Reference: _reference/IfCelsFahr.java_)

   (Solution: _IfCelsFahrLoop.java_)

2. Write a program that presents a numeric menu to a user. The menu should present five options:
   ```
   1. Greeting
   2. Advice
   3. Wisdom
   4. Help
   5. Quit
   ```

   Users can select options until they decide to quit the program.
   * `1` prints a greeting to the screen.
   * `2` prints advice on Java or any other topic.
   * `3` prints wisdom, perhaps an old saying.
   * `4` explains how the program works, such as "Select an option, enter 5 to quit."
   * `5` prints a farewell message and the program ends.

   Design this class to have several methods, such as `printMenu()` and `printGreeting()`.

   (Solution: _LoopMenu.java_)

3. Modify the calculator app from the `Switch` section.  Use a `boolean` variable and a `do-while` loop to allow the user to keep entering numbers and operations until they enter `QUIT` or `EXIT` as the operation.

   (Reference: _reference/CalculatorSwitch.java_)

   (Solution: _CalculatorLoop.java_)
