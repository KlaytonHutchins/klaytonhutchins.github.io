## Code Blocks

If we want the `if` statement to control more than one statement, we use a code block.

> #### code block
> Anything in curly braces `{  }`.

```java
if (condition) {
  statement to control
  other statement to control
}
```
Use a code block for your `if` statement even if it controls only one statement.
* `{ }` make the code more readable.

```java
if (condition) {
  statement
}
```
