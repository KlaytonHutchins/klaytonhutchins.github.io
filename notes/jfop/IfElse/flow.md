## Sequential Execution

We have seen how our programs execute _sequentially_ in the order they appear in the source file, top-to-bottom, beginning-to-end.

Calling a method makes the code enter that method, then return to the place after the method call. This is still sequential.

We may want to change this _flow of execution_ so that some statements only execute when certain conditions are true.

We do this with _conditionals_.

> A decision making statement in a program that controls whether a section of code executes.

The most basic conditional is the `if` statement.
