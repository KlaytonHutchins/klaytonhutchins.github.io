## Expressions: Where the Work Gets Done

_Statements_ are roughly equivalent to sentences in a language, and make up a complete instruction to the computer.

_Expressions_ are the parts that make up statements.

> #### expression
> a combination of literals, variables, and _operators_.

> #### operator
> a symbol in your source code that specifies an operation to be
performed on some data (its _operands_).

There are several types of expressions:
* _Assignment expressions_ — assign data to a variable.
  ```java
    age = 29
  ```
* _Arithmetic expressions_ — perform arithmetic calculations.
  ```java
    5 + 3
  ```
* _Relational expressions_ — come up with a true/false answer to a question.
  ```java
    i < 10
  ```
* _Logical expressions_ — combine multiple true/false answers into one by using more operators.
  ```java
    i < 10 && j > 5
  ```
