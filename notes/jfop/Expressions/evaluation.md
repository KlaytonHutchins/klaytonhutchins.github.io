## Expression Evaluation: The Result

When an expression is executed, it will _evaluate_ to a single value, the result.

> #### evaluate
> execute an operator with its operands and arrive at a result

| Operator | Result |
| -------- | ------ |
| Arithmetic operators | number |
| Relational operators | boolean (true or false) |
| Logical operators | boolean |
| Assignment operators<sup>*</sup> | the value assigned |

<sub>* Explained in  [Assignment Expressions](assignment.md)</sub>

Evaluating is about getting a result.
* Evaluating `3 + 5` results in 8.
* Evaluating `3 < 5` results in true.
* Evaluating `3 < 5 and 10 < 7` results in false.
