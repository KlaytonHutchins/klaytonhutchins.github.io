## Labs

We are going to write your name to the screen using methods. Each method has a specific job and a name relating to that job.

A complete solution is listed after all steps.

1. Create a class called `MyName`. Define a `main` method (make sure you do so correctly).

2. After `main`, define a method called `firstName()` that prints your first name to the screen, but without a newline character. It should look like

   ```
   public static void firstName(){
       System.out.print("YOUR_FIRST_NAME");
   }
   ```

3. Define another method called `lastName()` that prints your last name to the screen.

4. Inside of `main`, call firstName() and lastName().

5. There is no space between the two names. Define a method called `space()` that prints a space character, `" "`, to the screen. Call it in the appropriate place in `main`.

6. Add a `System.out.println();` after the call to lastName().

7. Lastly, define a method called `fullName()`. It will call firstName(), space(), and lastName().

8. Call fullName() from `main`. Your full name should now print to the screen twice.

(Solution: _MyName.java_)
