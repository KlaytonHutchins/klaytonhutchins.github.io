1. Write a program that declares an array of five integers, `int[] numbers = { 28, 33, 55, 21, 35 };`. Use a `for` loop to determine the smallest and largest number in the array, and print them.

   (Solution: _MinMaxFor.java_)

2. Rewrite your solution to **1** to use a _foreach_ loop.

   (Solution: _MinMaxForEach.java_)

3. Rewrite your solution to **1** to use a `while` loop.

   (Solution: _MinMaxWhile.java_)

4. Modify your solution to **2** to prompt the user for the five values to store in the array.

   (Solution: _MinMaxPrompt.java_)

5. (Optional) Write a program to print the reverse of any integer value. For example, for the integer 123, the program should print 321.

   (Solution: _Reverse.java_)
