## Literals

_Literals_ are pieces of data whose value cannot change (whereas variables represent those values).

* If someone tells you to add 2 to a number, `2` is a literal value — it has no other name and it represents a fixed amount.

* If someone tells you to put the letter _s_ at the end of a word, `s` is a literal value — it has no name and it represents one particular letter.

You can put literal values in your program representing data of any one of the previously mentioned data types.

* `int` literals do not contain a decimal point: `42`, `0`, `-123`, `1928374`.
* `double` literals _do_ contain a decimal point: `0.0`, `3.14`, `-15.9997`.
* `char` literals are always enclosed in a pair of single quotes: `'H'`, `'k'`,
`'9'`, `'('`, `'*'`.
* `boolean` literals are either of the Java keywords `true` or `false`.
* `String` literals are enclosed in double quotes: `"Hello world!"`, `"dog"`, `"Java is a programming language"`.

### Practice Exercise
A `char` literal appears between a pair of single quotes (`'`), and a `String` literal appears between a pair of double quotes (`"`). Getting this wrong is a compiler error.
