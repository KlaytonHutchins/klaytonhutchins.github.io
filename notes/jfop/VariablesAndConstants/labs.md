1. Write a program that defines two variables: one named `age` (for your age) and one named `mi` (for your middle initial). Initialize the variables appropriately. Have the program print your first name as a string literal, your middle initial from the variable, your last name as a string literal, the string ": Age: ", and your age from the variable.

2. Write a program that defines four variables named `score1`, `score2`, `score3`, and `score4` — one for each of a student's four test scores. Assign appropriate values to the variables. Define another variable named `average` in the program. Have the program calculate the average of the test scores and assign the result to the variable:
   ```java
   average = (score1 + score2 + score3 + score4) / 4;
   ```
   Print out the four test scores and the average.
