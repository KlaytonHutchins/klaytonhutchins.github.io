## Introduction to Eclipse

> #### Do This Now
> Go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/. Under _Desktop IDEs_ go to **Java EE**. Make sure you're looking at _Eclipse IDE for Java **EE** Developers_ and start the download for your operating system.

Developers use _Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)_ to maximize their productivity.

* An IDE includes sophisticated code editors, built-in compilation, testing, debugging, and many other features.

Popular Java IDEs include:

* **Eclipse**, originally from IBM, now open-source.

* **NetBeans**, originally from from Sun/Oracle, now open-source.

* **IntelliJ IDEA**, from JetBrains: a subscription-based commercial product.

Eclipse is the most popular open-source Java IDE available today.

* Eclipse can be customized with plugins, and there are hundreds of plugins available at the Eclipse Marketplace and other software sites.

* Initially created for Java developers, it's been adapted for many other languages and development tasks.

* Because it's written almost entirely in Java, it's available for multiple operating systems including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

You can find a wide variety of Eclipse _packages_ - combinations of the basic Eclipse Platform with plugins for particular languages and types of development

* The Eclipse Foundation provides several at http://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages

* Many third-party organizations have built their own Eclipse-based projects, both open-source and commercial.

* _Eclipse IDE for Java developers_ includes several important plugins, including the Eclipse _Java Developer Tools_ (_JDT_).

We're going to start with **Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers** which, in addition to Eclipse's extensive Java programming support, includes:

* Everything that's included in _Eclipse for Java Developers_.

* The _Web Tools Platform_ (_WTP_), a collection of tools for developing Java web applications.

* _Server Tools_ for managing web application servers during development.

* Integration with _Maven_, a popular build-automation tool.

* Lots more.

### Practice Exercise
The Eclipse Foundation comes out with a new major release every June.  The releases are primarily referred to by name rather than version number, with the names following a scientific/astronomical theme in ascending alphabetical order:
* Eclipse 1.0 - October, 2001
* Eclipse 2.0 - June, 2002
* Eclipse 3.0 - June, 2004
* Eclipse 3.1 - June, 2005
* Eclipse 3.2 (Callisto) - June, 2006
* Eclipse 3.3 (Europa) - June, 2007
* Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) - June, 2008
* Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) - June, 2009
* Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) - June, 2010
* Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) - June, 2011
* Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) - June, 2012
* Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) - June, 2013
* Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) - June, 2014
* Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) - June, 2015
* Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) - June, 2016
