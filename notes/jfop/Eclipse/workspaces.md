To run, Eclipse requires a _workspace_ - a dedicated directory to store the files for your programming projects.

* This directory should be used and managed exclusively by Eclipse.

You can create multiple workspaces.

* For example, you could have a workspace containing projects for a specific customer.

* You might have a workspace for a particular project, which may consist of multiple sub-projects.

When you start Eclipse it will ask you to select the workspace you want to work in.

* Eclipse only opens one workspace at a time.

### Drill
Launch Eclipse.  In the _Select a directory as a workspace_ dialog, change the _Workspace:_ to `/Users/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/SD/Java/workspace`.  Eclipse will create the `workspace` directory if it doesn't exist.
* Click **Launch**.
