## Importing Existing Java Code into Eclipse

To load existing Eclipse projects into your workspace, choose _File_ | _Import..._ | _General_ | _Existing Projects into Workspace_.

* If the projects are in a directory, such as another workspace, use _Select root directory_ and browse to where the projects are located.

  * You'll probably want to check the _Copy projects into workspace_ checkbox.

* If the projects are in a ZIP file (for example, a teammate exported them as a ZIP and sent you the ZIP), choose _Select archive file_ and browse to where you saved the ZIP.

> #### Do This Now
> Load the pre-created Eclipse projects for this course into your Eclipse workspace using the Import wizard.
> * The instructor will show you how to download the ZIP file.
> * Then, click on _File_ | _Import_ | _General_ | **_Existing Projects into Workspace_**. 
>   * Do NOT choose _Archive File_ in this step!
> * Click **Next**
> * Now choose the _Select archive file_ radio button, browse to the location of the student ZIP file, select it, and click **Open**.
> * Under _Projects_ you should see a list of the projects Eclipse sees in the ZIP file.
>   * If you don't see a list of projects here, you may have opened the wrong ZIP, or it didn't get downloaded properly, or something; the instructor will help you resolve this.
> * Click **Finish**.
> You should now see the imported projects in the _Package Explorer_ view.
