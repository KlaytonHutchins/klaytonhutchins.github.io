In this chapter we will discuss converting primitive data into other data types.

### Objectives
* Be able to convert operands to different data types.
* Understand and use the cast operator.
* Understand "promotion" in assignment and arithmetic.
* Understand truncation.

*  [Implicit Type Conversions](implicit.md) 
*  [Promotion of Data Types in Arithmetic](promotion.md) 
*  [Promotion in Integer Arithmetic](int-promotion.md) 
*  [The Cast Operator](casting.md) 
*  [Casting Hints](casting-hints.md) 
*  [Labs](labs.md)
