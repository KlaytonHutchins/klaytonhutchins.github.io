## Labs

For these labs do not use any existing `java.lang.Math` static methods.

1. In mathematics, the _floor_ function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. For example:

   _floor(25.95)_ yields 25

   _floor(-25.95)_ yields -26

   Create a program that prompts the user for a floating point number and reads it into a variable of type `double`. Use the cast operator to convert the number to the largest integer less than or equal to the number. Print out the results. (Hint: negative numbers will require more than just casting. Be sure to check your solution for decimals and whole numbers.)

   (Solution: _Floor.java_)

2. In mathematics, the _ceiling_ function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number. For example:

   _ceiling(25.95)_ yields 26

   _ceiling(-25.95)_ yields -25

   Write a program similar to (1) to print out the ceiling for any floating point number given by the user.

   (Solution: _Ceiling.java_)

3. Write a program that reads a floating point number from the user and prints out the number rounded to the nearest `int`.

   (Solution: _Round.java_)
