## Labs

1. Write a program that reads an `int` number from the user.  Use an expression to determine if the number is even (use the modulus operator, `%`.)  Store the result of the expression in a `boolean` variable.  Write an `if` statement that uses the variable to determine whether to print `Odd.` or `Even.`.

   (Solution: _solutions/OddOrEven.java_)

1. Write a program that prompts the user five times to enter an integer number.  The first time, store the number in an `int` variable, and print it out.  The remaining four times, use `*=` to multiply the variable by the user's input and print it again.

   (Solution: _solutions/Multiply.java_)

1. Write a program that reads a number from the user and prints out whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.  Use no `if` statements.

   (Solution: _solutions/PosNegZero.java_)
