## Memory and Java

To process data, a computer must bring the data into its _memory_.

* Computer memory is a working area where programs can place information they are using.
* When it starts, each program gets its own area of memory, which other
programs can't use.
* When a program finishes running, it releases all of its memory so that other programs can use it when they are run.

The smallest unit of memory is a _bit_.
* A bit is like a light switch: it's either on or off (1 or 0).
* In reality, it's like a bucket.
  * When it's full of electrons, it's ON: this is a 1.
  * When it's not, this is a 0.
* There are only two options, 0 or 1.

### Practice Exercise
The takeaway: all data is stored in memory as 0's and 1's.
