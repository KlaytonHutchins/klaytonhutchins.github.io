## Labs

There is already a `labs` package in the project for this chapter.

1. Write a program that declares and initializes two int variables:
   * `big = 2147483647;`
   * `bigger = big + 1;`

   For the big variable, use underscores in the literal value to make it easier to read. Print them both out and explain the results.

   (Solution: _Overflow.java_)

2. Write a program to see what variable types can do.
   * Declare an int variable `validInt` and assign it a valid value.
   * Declare a long variable `longInt` and assign `validInt` to it.
   * Now try to assign `longInt` back to `validInt`. Did it work?

   (Solution: _ValidInt.java_)

3. Try to draw the memory length diagram on [Primitives and Memory](primitives-memory.md). Erase it and try again.
