## Data Types You've Used

So far we have used four of the eight _primitive_ Java data types.

* `int` - integer data: `1`, `-95`, `0`
* `char` - character data: `'a'`, `'9'`, `'!'`, `'\t'`
* `double` - floating point data: `3.14`, `0.0`, `-15.9997`
* `boolean` - a `true` or `false` value

In this chapter we will look at four more data types, and how Java stores them in memory.

* `byte` - the smallest integer data type, with a very limited range of values.
* `short` - a smaller version of `int`, with a smaller range of values.
* `long` - a larger version of `int`, with a larger range of values.
* `float` - a smaller version of `double`, with a smaller range of values.

> #### primitive data type
> A data type in Java that holds a simple data value, like a number or character. This is different than a _reference_, which holds the address of an object.
