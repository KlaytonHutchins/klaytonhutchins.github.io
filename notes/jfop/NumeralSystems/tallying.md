## Counting and Tallying

The simplest way to record a count of something is to just make a mark for each thing counted.

```
|||   - This many licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop
```

As the count goes higher these tally marks start to take a lot of space and are hard to read.

```
||||||||||||||||||||||||  - Hours in a day
```

We also need a better way to record if there was nothing to count besides the absence of a tally mark.

```
0     - Zero ponies for you.  Not yours.
```
