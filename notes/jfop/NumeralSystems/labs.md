## Labs

1. Create a program with a method that takes an `int` parameter.  The method should loop from 1 to that number, printing each number in hexadecimal, decimal, and octal. Call this method from `main`.

   (Solution: _PrintNumbers.java_)

2. Modify your program to include the binary number in the output.  Test by printing the numbers up to 66,000.

   (Solution: _PrintNumbers2.java_)

3. Modify your program to print the numbers in fixed-width columns.  Hexadecimal numbers should be padded with leading zeros and be prefixed `0x`. Binary numbers should be prefixed with `0b`.  Octal numbers should be prefixed with a single `0`.
