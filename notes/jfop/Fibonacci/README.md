## Fibonacci Series

The _Fibonacci series_ is a series of numbers in which the first two numbers are 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So, the third Fibonacci number is (0 + 1) = 1. The next is (1 + 1) = 2. Then (1 + 2) = 3. Then (2 + 3) = 5. Then (3 + 5) = 8. And so on. The Fibonacci series has many interesting mathematical properties and shows up in surprising places in nature.

* Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.

* Remember that the first two (known as f0 and f1) are predefined as 0 and 1. All subsequent numbers are calculated from there.

* Modify your solution (if necessary) so that the sequence number is printed out next to the fibonacci value. Make sure that sequence numbers 0 and 1 match up with the first two predefined values:
   ```
   0: 0
   1: 1
   2: 1
   3: 2
   4: 3
   5: 5
   6: 8
   7: 13
   ...
   ```
