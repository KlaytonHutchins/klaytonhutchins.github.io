1. Write a program that prompts the user for a list of five integers. Place each of the numbers in a separate variable, then:
   1. Print each of the numbers separated by a space.
   2. Print each of the numbers separated by a tab.
   3. Print each of the numbers separated by a newline.

2. Write a program that prompts the user for a String department code, a floating-point salary, and an integer employee id. Put each of the items in a separate variable, then:
   1. Print each of the items and a string literal label separated by a space.
   2. Print each of the items and a string literal label separated by a tab.
   3. Print each of the items and a string literal label separated by a newline.

3. Write a program that prints out your initials as a large banner, with each large letter made up of the same letter. Don't prompt the user to enter initials, just _hard code_ your initials. Here's what we mean for the output:

   ```
    GGGGG  EEEEEEE BBBBBB
   G       E       B     B
   G       E       B     B
   G  GGG  EEEEE   BBBBBB
   G     G E       B     B
   G     G E       B     B
    GGGGG  EEEEEEE BBBBBB 
   ```

4. Write a program that uses your initials to draw a picture of a house. Print the roof in the method `static void printRoof()` and the floor in the method `static void printFloor()`. (Make sure to call the two methods from `main`).

   ```
                     EEEE
           BBBBBBBB  E  E
         B          BE  E
       B               BE
     B                   B
   B                       B
    G  GGGG         GGGG  G
    G  G  G  EEEEE  G  G  G
    G  GGGG  E   E  GGGG  G
    G        E  EE        G
    G        E   E        G
    GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
   ```
