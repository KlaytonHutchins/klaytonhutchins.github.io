## Screen Output

The simplest way a program can communicate with its user is to print data on the screen.

* The computer screen is called the _standard output_ device ("standard out").
  ```java
    System.out.println("You were " + age + " in 2010.");
  ```

* Error messages are usually sent to the _standard error_ device. This is also your computer screen, but could be set to a text file.
  ```java
    System.err.println("Your age cannot be negative!");
  ```
