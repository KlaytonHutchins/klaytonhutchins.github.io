## Labs

In this lab you will build a JUnit test class for each of the entities we created in the introductory chapter. `Customer` and `Address` have already been completed in the previous _SkillDrills_.

1. Build a *JUnit* test class for the `Staff` entity called `StaffTest`.
   * Write a test that makes sure the `Staff` class's field mappings are correct for:
     * `firstName`
     * `lastName`
     * `email`

1. Build *JUnit* test class for the `Language` entity called `LanguageTest`.
   * Write a test that makes sure the `Language` class's field mappings are correct for:
     * `name`

1. Build *JUnit* test class for the `Film` entity called `FilmTest`.
   * Write a test that makes sure the `Film` class's field mappings are correct for:
     * `title`
     * `description`
     * `releaseYear`
     * `rentalRate`
     * `length`
     * `replacementCost`
