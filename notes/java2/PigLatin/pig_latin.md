### Pig Latin Rules

Most words in Pig Latin end in "ay." Use the rules below to translate normal English into Pig Latin.

* If a word starts with one or more consonants, move those consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."

  * Example: `happy` = `appyh` + `ay` = `appyhay`

  * Example: `child` = `ildch` + `ay` = `ildchay`

* If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word.

  * Example: `awesome` = `awesome` + `way` = `awesomeway`

Putting It All Together

The sentence "Pig Latin is hard to speak." is written below in Pig Latin:

*Igpay Atinlay isway ardhay otay eakspay.*

Notice how "Igpay" is actually "Pig." Because the first character of pig is moved to the end, with "ay" added to the end, it makes Pig Latin hard to read.
