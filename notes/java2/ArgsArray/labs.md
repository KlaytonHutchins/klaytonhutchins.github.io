## Labs

1. Write a new Java program.  In its `main` check to see if exactly one argument was passed on the command line and if not, exit with an appropriate message.

   Otherwise, convert the argument to an `int` using the code

   ```java
   int count = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

   ```

   and then use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to the given number.

   (Solution: _solutions/CountTo.java_)
