## `enum` Details

The `enum` declaration generates a new class behind the scenes.

* Each `enum` constant is declared as a `public`, `static`, and `final` field within the generated class.

* There is no `public` constructor written for the class.

  * You cannot create new `enum` constants at runtime.


### Practice Exercise
> `java.lang.Enum` is the common base class for all `enum`s.
