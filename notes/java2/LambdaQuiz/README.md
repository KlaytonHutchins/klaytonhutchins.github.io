title: Lambda Example
---


The purpose of this lab is to practice creating lambda expressions.

### Setup

Download and import the [LambdaQuiz](resources/LambdaQuiz.zip) Eclipse project.

### Quiz

The class `LambdaQuiz/com.example.lambdas.LambdaExamples` contains instructions for translating a text description of functionality to a lambda expression.

Many of these can be written several ways, so practice using lambda syntax.

### Stretch Goals

To test your lambdas, write JUnit tests. The test will simply call the lambda's implemented method.

* The last task should certainly be tested for functionality.
* Testing anything that uses `System.out` is difficult. Verify it visually.
