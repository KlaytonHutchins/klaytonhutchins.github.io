## Labs
Sets can only contain unique elements. In these labs we will examine and use this feature.

1. The file `names.txt` at the root of the `SetInterface` project contains many names. Create a program to:
   * Add each name to a `List`.
   * Add each name to a `Set`.
   * Display the size of the `List`, the size of the `Set`, and the number of lines in the `names.txt` file.

   (Solution: _NameApp.java_)
