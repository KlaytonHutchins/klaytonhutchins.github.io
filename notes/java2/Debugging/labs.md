1. Open `Debugging/com.example.debugging.labs.BuggyProgram`.

   The expected output of this class is

   ```
   make=Bravado, model=Banshee, color=blue, numberOfWheels=4, purchasePrice=74000.0
   make=Dundreary, model=Landstalker, color=yellow, numberOfWheels=4, purchasePrice=63999.99
   make=Dundreary, model=Admiral, color=green, numberOfWheels=4, purchasePrice=23500.0
   make=Declasse, model=Sabre, color=red, numberOfWheels=4, purchasePrice=31000.0
   make=Maibatsu, model=Mule, color=white, numberOfWheels=4, purchasePrice=57300.0
   ```

   You must examine the class and find its bugs.
   * Do not just fix the code.
   * Do not put any `System.out.println()` statements.
   * Add breakpoints and step through the code to find the bug.
     * Start with a breakpoint in `main`, and then step into methods.
     * Add additional breakpoints in methods as you move through code.
     * Look at variable values in the _Variables_ tab.
