title: Commenting Out Code
---


One of the oldest debugging techniques is to comment out code.

* Locate where you think the problem is occurring in your program.

* Put comment characters in front of or around the statements that might be causing the problem.

* Recompile and reexecute the program.

* Determine if your program is now working correctly.

* Repeat the process until you've identified the statement causing the error.
