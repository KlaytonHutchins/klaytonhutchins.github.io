Programs called _debuggers_ help you follow the execution of your program without commenting out code or adding debugging print statements.

A debugger allows you to set _breakpoints_ in your program where you want the program to stop while it's executing.

> #### breakpoint
> A marker, like a line number in your code, that tells the debugger to pause the program when it reaches that line of code.
>
> A breakpoint is not something you add to your source code. Instead, it's data _about_ your code that the debugger uses.

When the program stops, you can check the values of variables.

You can then _step_ through the program from where it paused.

> #### step
> Control the sequential execution of the program.
>
> You tell the debugger when to move to the next line of code.
