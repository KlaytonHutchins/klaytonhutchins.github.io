## Labs
In these labs we will use the `List` interface with implementation classes.

1. Write a program that uses `Math.random()` to build a `List` of `10` integers between `10` and `100` (inclusive) and prints them to the screen.
   * Choose whichever implementation class you want.
   * Run it several times to see if you can get `10` and `100`.

   (Solution: _NumbersList.java_)

2. Add a `sortAndPrintList` method, which takes a `List` of `Integer`s, sorts them, and prints the results.

   * Don't try to develop a sort algorithm on your own, rather search the Internet for existing algorithms like _bubble sort_ or _insertion sort_. If you have time, try multiple sort algorithms and be prepared to discuss the details of each with a partner.

   (Solution: _SortNumbersList.java_)
