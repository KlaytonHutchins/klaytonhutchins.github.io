## Lottery: Powerball

Reuse your ping pong ball and hopper classes from the NBA Draft project to simulate a Powerball drawing.

#### Task 1

In the same project as your NBA Draft application, add a package for Powerball classes.

#### Task 2

Design classes for simulating a Powerball drawing.
* Who owns and loads the hopper(s)?
* Who draws the winners?
* Who initiates the drawing and reports the results?

The results of the drawing - winning numbers plus powerball number - should be returned to the class that initiated the drawing so they can be published.  That is, don't just print the balls as they're drawn.

#### Task 3

Implement and run a Powerball application.  Ideally, no ball or hopper code should need to be changed.
