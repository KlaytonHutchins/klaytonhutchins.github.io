## Labs

Files for this lab are in `com.example.innerclasses.labs`.

Use `ShowSortedHits.java`, `AccessLogComparator.java`, and `access_log` as starter files for these labs.

1. Modify `ShowSortedHits.java` so it uses a _member inner class_ as a `Comparator`, rather than having `AccessLogComparator.java` as a separate file.

   (Solution: _ShowSortedHits2.java_)

1. Change your solution to the previous lab to use a _local inner class_ instead of a member inner class.

   (Solution: _ShowSortedHits3.java_)

1. Change your solution to the previous lab to use an _anonymous inner class_ instead of a local inner class.

   (Solution: _ShowSortedHits4.java_)
