When a building is to be erected which is intended to stand for ages, the foundation should be
firmly laid. The Constitution proposed to your acceptance is designed, not for yourselves alone,
but for generations yet unborn. The principles, therefore, upon which the social compact is
founded, ought to have been clearly and precisely stated, and the most express and full
declaration of rights to have been made. But on this subject there is almost an entire silence.

If we may collect the sentiments of the people of America, from their own most solemn
declarations, they hold this truth as self-evident, that all men are by nature free. No one man,
therefore, or any class of men, have a right, by the law of nature, or of God, to assume or
exercise authority over their fellows. The origin of society, then, is to be sought, not in any
natural right which one man has to exercise authority over another, but in the united consent of
those who associate. The mutual wants of men at first dictated the propriety of forming societies:
and when they were established, protection and defense pointed out the necessity of instituting
government. In a state of nature every individual pursues his own interest; in this pursuit it
frequently happened, that the possessions or enjoyments of one were sacrificed to the views and
designs of another; thus the weak were a prey to the strong, the simple and unwary were subject
to impositions from those who were more crafty and designing. In this state of things, every
individual was insecure; common interest, therefore, directed that government should be
established, in which the force of the whole community should be collected, and under such
directions, as to protect and defend every one who composed it. The common good, therefore, is
the end of civil government, and common consent, the foundation on which it is established. To
effect this end, it was necessary that a certain portion of natural liberty should be surrendered, in
order that what remained should be preserved. How great a proportion of natural freedom is
necessary to be yielded by individuals, when they submit to government, I shall not inquire. So
much, however, must be given, as will be sufficient to enable those to whom the administration
of the government is committed, to establish laws for the promoting the happiness of the
community, and to carry those laws into effect. But it is not necessary, for this purpose, that
individuals should relinquish all their natural rights. Some are of such a nature that they cannot
be surrendered. Of this kind are the rights of conscience, the right of enjoying and defending life,
etc. Others are not necessary to be resigned in order to attain the end for which government is
instituted; these therefore ought not to be given up. To surrender them, would counteract the very
end of government, to wit, the common good. From these observations it appears, that in forming
a government on its true principles, the foundation should be laid in the manner I before stated,
by expressly reserving to the people such of their essential rights as are not necessary to be
parted with. The same reasons which at first induced mankind to associate and institute
government, will operate to influence them to observe this precaution. If they had been disposed
to conform themselves to the rule of immutable righteousness, government would not have been
requisite. It was because one part exercised fraud, oppression and violence, on the other, that
men came together, and agreed that certain rules should be formed to regulate the conduct of all,
and the power of the whole community lodged in the hands of rulers to enforce an obedience to
them. But rulers have the same propensities as other men; they are as likely to use the power
with which they are vested, for private purposes, and to the injury and oppression of those over
whom they are placed, as individuals in a state of nature are to injure and oppress one another. It
is therefore as proper that bounds should be set to their authority, as that government should have
at first been instituted to restrain private injuries.

This principle, which seems so evidently founded in the reason and nature of things, is confirmed
by universal experience. Those who have governed, have been found in all ages ever active to
enlarge their powers and abridge the public liberty. This has induced the people in all countries,
where any sense of freedom remained, to fix barriers against the encroachments of their rulers.
The country from which we have derived our origin, is an eminent example of this. Their magna
charta and bill of rights have long been the boast, as well as the security of that nation. I need say
no more, I presume, to an American, than that this principle is a fundamental one, in all the
Constitutions of our own States; there is not one of them but what is either founded on a
declaration or bill of rights, or has certain express reservation of rights interwoven in the body of
them. From this it appears, that at a time when the pulse of liberty beat high, and when an appeal
was made to the people to form Constitutions for the government of themselves, it was their
universal sense, that such declarations should make a part of their frames of government. It is,
therefore, the more astonishing, that this grand security to the rights of the people is not to be
found in this Constitution.

It has been said, in answer to this objection, that such declarations of rights, however requisite
they might be in the Constitutions of the States, are not necessary in the general Constitution,
because, "in the former case, every thing which is not reserved is given; but in the latter, the
reverse of the proposition prevails, and every thing which is not given is reserved." It requires
but little attention to discover, that this mode of reasoning is rather specious than solid. The
powers, rights and authority, granted to the general government by this Constitution, are as
complete, with respect to every object to which they extend, as that of any State government-it
reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness-life, liberty, and property are under its
control. There is the same reason, therefore, that the exercise of power, in this case, should be
restrained within proper limits, as in that of the State governments. To set this matter in a clear
light, permit me to instance some of the articles of the bills of rights of the individual States, and
apply them to the case in question.

For the security of life, in criminal prosecutions, the bills of rights of most of the States have
declared, that no man shall be held to answer for a crime until he is made fully acquainted with
the charge brought against him; he shall not be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against
himself-the witnesses against him shall be brought face to face, and he shall be fully heard by
himself or counsel. That it is essential to the security of life and liberty, that trial of facts be in
the vicinity where they happen. Are not provisions of this kind as necessary in the general
government, as in that of a particular State? The powers vested in the new Congress extend in
many cases to life; they are authorized to provide for the punishment of a variety of capital
crimes, and no restraint is laid upon them in its exercise, save only, that "the trial of all crimes,
except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be in the State where the
said crimes shall have been committed." No man is secure of a trial in the county where he is
charged to have committed a crime; he may be brought from Niagara to New York, or carried
from Kentucky to Richmond for trial for an offense supposed to be committed. What security is
there, that a man shall be furnished with a full and plain description of the charges against him?
That he shall be allowed to produce all proof he can in his favor? That he shall see the witnesses
against him face to face, or that he shall be fully heard in his own defense by himself or counsel?

For the security of liberty it has been declared, "that excessive bail should not be required, nor
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted. That all warrants, without
oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or seize any person, his papers or property, are
grievous and oppressive."

These provisions are as necessary under the general government as under that of the individual
States; for the power of the former is as complete to the purpose of requiring bail, imposing
fines, inflicting punishments, granting search warrants, and seizing persons, papers, or property,
in certain cases, as the other.

For the purpose of securing the property of the citizens, it is declared by all the States, "that in all
controversies at law, respecting property, the ancient mode of trial by jury is one of the best
securities of the rights of the people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable."

Does not the same necessity exist of reserving this right under their national compact, as in that
of the States? Yet nothing is said respecting it. In the bills of rights of the States it is declared,
that a well regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government; that as
standing armies in time of peace are dangerous, they are not to be kept up, and that the military
should be kept under strict subordination to, and controlled by, the civil power.

The same security is as necessary in this Constitution, and much more so; for the general
government will have the sole power to raise and to pay armies, and are under no control in the
exercise of it; yet nothing of this is to be found in this new system.

I might proceed to instance a number of other rights, which were as necessary to be reserved,
such as, that elections should be free, that the liberty of the press should be held sacred; but the
instances adduced are sufficient to prove that this argument is without foundation. Besides, it is
evident that the reason here assigned was not the true one, why the framers of this Constitution
omitted a bill of rights; if it had been, they would not have made certain reservations, while they
totally omitted others of more importance. We find they have, in the ninth section of the first
article declared, that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of
rebellion,-that no bill of attainder, or ex post facto law, shall be passed,-that no title of nobility
shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what
propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of
suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of
nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these
are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers
which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones
granted by this Constitution.

So far is it from being true, that a bill of rights is less necessary in the general Constitution than
in those of the States, the contrary is evidently the fact. This system, if it is possible for the
people of America to accede to it, will be an original compact; and being the last wilt, in the
nature of things, vacate every former agreement inconsistent with it. For it being a plan of
government received and ratified by the whole people, all other forms which are in existence at
the time of its adoption, must yield to it. This is expressed in positive and unequivocal terms in
the sixth article: "That this Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in
pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound
thereby, any thing in the Constitution, or laws of any State, to the contrary notwithstanding."

"The senators and representatives before-mentioned, and the members of the several State
legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and of the several
States, shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution."

It is therefore not only necessarily implied thereby, but positively expressed, that the different
State Constitutions are repealed and entirely done away, so far as they are inconsistent with this,
with the laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof, or with treaties made, or which shall be
made, under the authority of the United States. Of what avail will the Constitutions of the
respective States be to preserve the rights of its citizens? Should they be pled, the answer would
be, the Constitution of the United States, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, is the supreme
law, and all legislatures and judicial officers, whether of the General or State governments, are
bound by oath to support it. No privilege, reserved by the bills of rights, or secured by the State
governments, can limit the power granted by this, or restrain any laws made in pursuance of it. It
stands, therefore, on its own bottom, and must receive a construction by itself, without any
reference to any other. And hence it was of the highest importance, that the most precise and
express declarations and reservations of rights should have been made.

This will appear the more necessary, when it is considered, that not only the Constitution and
laws made in pursuance thereof, but alt treaties made, under the authority of the United States,
are the supreme law of the land, and supersede the Constitutions of all the States. The power to
make treaties, is vested in the president, by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the
senate. I do not find any limitation or restriction to the exercise of this power. The most
important article in any Constitution may therefore be repealed, even without a legislative act.
Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been
restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought.

So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people
that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States,
are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage.
